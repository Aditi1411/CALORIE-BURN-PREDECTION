# CALORIE-BURN-PREDICTION
# 🔥 Calorie Burn Prediction System

A **machine learning–based Calorie Burn Prediction web application** that estimates the number of calories burned during physical activity based on user input parameters such as age, gender, weight, height, duration, and heart rate.

The application is built using **Python and Streamlit** and provides instant calorie burn predictions through an interactive web interface.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters personal and workout details:
   - Gender
   - Age
   - Height
   - Weight
   - Exercise duration
   - Heart rate
2. Input data is processed and passed to a trained ML model
3. The model predicts the **estimated calories burned**
